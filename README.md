# Facebook Phishing Example (Educational Purposes)

This project is designed to demonstrate how phishing attacks can trick users into revealing their personal information. **Note: This example is for educational purposes only. It is important to never use phishing tactics for malicious reasons.**

## How It Works:
1. The user is presented with a fake Facebook login form that asks for their username and password.
2. When the user submits the form, instead of logging them in, a message appears saying "You got Hacked".
3. The user is then instructed to check their browser's developer console, where the submitted login credentials (username and password) are shown.

This project is a simplified demonstration of a phishing attack and is intended to raise awareness about the risks of entering personal information on fake or untrusted websites.

## Steps to Run:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Enter any username and password in the fake login form.
4. After submission, the console will display the entered information.

## Important:
- This project is for educational purposes only and should never be used for harmful activities.
- Always educate others about phishing attacks and promote online safety.
